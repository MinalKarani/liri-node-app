# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

liri can take in one of the following commands:

   * node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'

   * node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'

   * node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>

   * node liri.js do-what-it-says
   
   __node liri.js spotify-this-song <song name here>__
  Liri will retrieve song information like Artist(s), The song's name, A preview link of the song, The album of song from the Spotify API
